# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare a tidy dataset that can be used for further analysis. 

The dataset used comes from the [UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

## Files in this Repository
- `run_analysis.R`: R script that performs all data cleaning and tidying steps.
- `tidyData.txt`: The resulting tidy dataset generated by the script.
- `CodeBook.md`: Description of the variables, data, and transformations.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project (this file).

## How to Run
1. Make sure all raw data files from the UCI HAR Dataset are in the working directory.
2. Open `run_analysis.R` in R or RStudio.
3. Run the script.
4. The script will generate `tidyData.txt` in the working directory.

## Notes
- The script merges the training and test datasets.
- Only measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement are extracted.
- Descriptive activity names are applied.
- Variable names are made descriptive.
- The tidy dataset contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
